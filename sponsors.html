                        Since its incorporation, Stein Industries Inc. has developed an extensive product line to meet the highest industrial standards in the broadcast, power generation, pollution control, power distribution and advanced research sectors. Stein Industries Inc. manufactures power supplies for use with the new multi-collector, energy saving IOT devices now being introduced by various tube vendors. More than five years ago Stein Industries Inc. acquired a small manufacturer of electronic components utilized in our Transformers. This acquisition has led to the growth and development of our contract electronics manufacturing, LED lighting product line and the luxlinx&trade; smart lighting control solutions. Stein Industries Inc. will continue developing by addressing the needs of our customers and making investments in research and development to innovate existing products and creating cutting-edge solutions for the future.

                        WEEF stands for the Waterloo Engineering Endowment Foundation. The foundation was founded in 1990 by two engineering students, Avi Belinsky and John Vellinga. The goal of WEEF is to continuously improve the educational environment for undergraduate engineering students, and maintain our outstanding reputation.

                    <p class="content-text">
                        The premise of WEEF is simple. WEEF collects donations and puts them into a fund. The interest earned on the fund is spent each year on undergraduate laboratory equipment, student projects, computer upgrades and academic tools/teaching facilities. The principal portion of the fund is never spent which allows the interest each year to grow, hence "The Gift That Keeps On Giving". The donations that build the fund come from three sources: student donations, Employer Matching Contribution (EMC), and engineering Alumni (including graduates' Plummer's Pledge). As of 2018, the WEEF fund has a principal of over $15,000,000. WEEF is proud to support undergraduate engineering across all departments at the University of Waterloo.
