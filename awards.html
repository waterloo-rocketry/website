                            The Category Second Place Awards recognize the teams with the second highest overall scores in each of the six competition categories, with this category representing Student Researched and Developed (SRAD) Hybrid/Liquid engines targeting an apogee of 30,000 feet. Teams are scored on the project technical report, competency of design, quality of construction, degree of student development, flight performance, and operating procedures. Our team received this award for finishing second in our category at the 2023 IREC, with the debut flight of LotS achieving the closest altitude to 30,000 ft achieved by an SRAD hybrid rocket at the Spaceport America Cup.

                            The Dr. Gil Moore Award for Innovation recognizes a team whose project includes one or more features (including analytic or operational processes as well as components or assemblies) the judging panel finds genuinely "novel", "inventive", or solving a unique problem identified by the team. Our team was presented with this award for the design of a novel 3D-printed rocket nozzle. The manufacturing of this design was made possible through a sponsorship collaboration with the Multi-Scale Additive Manufacturing lab (MSAM) at the University of Waterloo.
