### Waterloo Rocketry Website

Hey y'all!

This is the repo for the Waterloo Rocketry website at waterloorocketry.com.

If you're on the team and would like to contribute, message me (Jacob) and I'll add you as a collaborator. The live site lives on the gh-pages branch. Please do not commit directly to this branch. If you want to make changes, please clone the repo, create your own development branch, and submit a pull request back to gh-pages when you're done working. Also feel free to use the issues feature - it's an easy way to keep track of everything that needs to be changed without digging through team Slack message history.

I think that's all. Message Jacob if you have any questions/concerns/problems/etc.

Happy web devving ;)

#### Style Guide
We generally try to use British/Canadian spellings over American ones. A non-exhaustive list of relevant words this impacts:
* Aluminium, not aluminum
* Mould, not mold
* Fibre(glass), not fiber(glass)

Consistency matters more than strictly going the Canadian way - if you're unsure, try `grepping` it (or ask one of us). :)
